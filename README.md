# HinfoBot

HinfoBot is purely an educational project, written in Haskell. 
The purpose of this project is to use https://newsapi.org to 
present data in a Discord server on a regular interval (likely 1 request per day)

It is entirely non-commercial code, and anyone else seeking to build a commercial 
Haskell App who would for some reason like to use my API wrapper can do so. 

# Building 
```bash
./build.sh
```
